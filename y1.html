    <p>Every student has big dreams in his/her eyes when he/she enter college but unfortunately, some students totally give up when they come in the second or third year. One of the main reasons for that is they don’t focus much on studies in initial days, or they don’t know what they need to do for getting into their dream company and when students of the same age start getting good internships or doing a good performance in contests, they feel disheartened. Everyone goes through this stage of imposter syndrome and the only thing you can do so that you don’t feel that way is by being consistent in your efforts from start.</p>
      <h4>1st Year (Ist Semester)</h4>
    <p>Your college starts and you have stepped into the world of programming, but you’re confused about which language to choose and how to start learning to program. If you’re a newbie, the answer to all your questions lies here:<br />
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-learn-programming/">How to Learn Programming?</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/which-programming-language-should-i-choose-as-a-beginner/">Which Programming Language Should I Choose as a Beginner?</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Set-Up Your Laptop</h4>
If you’ve not bought a laptop yet, buy a decent laptop (with 512 GB SSD and at least 8 GB RAM). DOS/Ubuntu laptops are generally cheaper than Windows Laptops but you can install a dual boot of DOS/Ubuntu OS in your Windows Laptop. Try to stop using Windows now.<br />

You need to start using a UNIX-based OS. If you have a Macbook then you already have a UNIX-based OS. If you have a Windows or DOS laptop, install Ubuntu.
